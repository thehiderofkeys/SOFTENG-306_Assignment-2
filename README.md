# SOFTENG-306-Assignment-2 | _Green Quest: My Story_

## Introduction of the game
Welcome to Team Environmentally Sustainable Ninjas' game - Green Quest: My Story. 
This game was built for 10-12 year olds in mind in educating them in climate change. The users will be playing as Choi - a child aimed to represent the target audience, and accompanied by Greta the wizard that guides Choi throughout the levels.

## Background of the game
Choi lives in a world that is plagued by the evil doings of a mysterios force and is tasked to combat these evil forces by doing good in the environment. Choi ventures through the game world to get stronger and train to defeat the mysterious force. Join Choi in an adventure of a lifetime!

## Game features
Health and Lives: The users of this serious game will be challenged by the limited health of the controlled character, this enables the player to be more strategic when traversing through the game; without mindlessly spamming the controls. This in hope will encourage the user to learn more critically through playing this game.

Achievements: Positive feedback is critical to effective learning and it encourages the user to continuously explore the game. This could be shown based on the userâ€™s progression or completeness in collecting certain in-game artefacts. 

Sound: The team is planning to generate a playlist of game sounds and potentially music in-house. This aims to enhance user experience via audible feedback and providing a more convincing gaming environment.

Monetisation: Monetisation is an aspect of game design that is less about the user experience more about the longevity and continuation of the game if it were to be published. Resources will be required to maintain and update the game. Team 12 has a few ideas regarding how this could be implemented, via product placements (or advertisements), or by a one-time game purchase.

UI Customisation: Users can enhance their personal experience by customising the user interface to their environment. Users can choose from a light theme and a dark theme depending on their preferences and sensitivity to blue light.
