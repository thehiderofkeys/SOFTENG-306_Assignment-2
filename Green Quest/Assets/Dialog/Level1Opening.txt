G
The whole world needs your help. In the future there is a mysterious evil figure that ruins the whole planet. It becomes . . . uninhabitable to all. The only way to stop it is for you to act now, in the present before it's too late.

What can I possibly do to help? I am just a kid, shouldn't more powerful people be trying to help?

G
My magical powers are telling me that this evil force cannot be stopped unless YOU act now. To start we are going to need to follow the evil figure's trail to undo their environmentally unsustainable destruction.

My powers are telling me it starts very close by with the bad influences in your house. We cannot conquer this problem all at once but instead we need to work on it in small consistent ways.

Exactly! That way you can stop the evil force before it gets out of control.

Let's start easy by turning off all of the lights and taps in your house. This will be a great starting step to reducing your electricity and water wastage.

It is pretty easy but setting these small habits are going to be very important for the future.
